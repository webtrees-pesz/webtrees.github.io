## How can I insert special characters or letters from a Czech or Norwegian keyboard?

In Windows 10:

* Hold down the “Windows Key” and press the semicolon (or the dot, depending on the keyboard language configuration) and a pop up window is revealed. Select the Omega (symbols) option and enter/select the character you want to use.

* Look for the keyboard icon on the right-hand side of your taskbar, bring up the on-screen keyboard, and hold down (or left-click and hold) your cursor over the letter you’d like to accent. If you don’t see the icon it needs to be turned on by right clicking on the taskbar and selecting the option.
